# Hackathon: KoalasVision

### Team Name: Coading_koalas

## Problem Statement:

In the modern workplace, an average of 55 million meetings occurs every week globally, totaling over 1 billion annually. Individuals invest significant time in these meetings. In a traditional setting, creating Meeting Minutes (M.o.M) consumes an average of 60 minutes per meeting, resulting in a substantial collective time spent on documentation. Additionally, an estimated $37 billion is lost annually due to unproductive meetings.

## Solution Overview:

KoalasVision addresses this challenge by automating the process of determining and prioritizing the level of meetings. It achieves this by generating meeting headings and, based on the priority level, summarizing audio content. KoalasVision provides users with a quick and efficient way to grasp the essence of their meetings, ultimately improving productivity and reducing time and financial losses associated with unproductive meetings.

## Aim:

To transform meetings into actionable insights through the development and implementation of KoalasVision, a cutting-edge solution for automated meeting summarization and prioritization.
